## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

Apotheke is built with a modern, scalable architecture designed for performance and maintainability.

### Frontend

The user interface is built using:

- **React with TypeScript**: Provides a robust and type-safe foundation.
- **Vite**: Offers a fast development server and optimized build process.
- **ShadCN UI**: A collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for a consistent and accessible design system.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **React Router**: Handles declarative routing throughout the application.
- **React Query**: Manages data fetching, caching, and state synchronization.
- **Framer Motion**: Used for smooth and engaging animations.
- **Zustand**: A fast and scalable state-management solution.
- **Recharts**: For rendering interactive charts and data visualizations.

- React with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- ShadCN UI components for consistent design
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- React Query for efficient data fetching

### Backend (Suggested Implementation)

The backend handles API requests, data persistence, and business logic. A suggested implementation includes:

- **Node.js with Express.js**: Provides a flexible and efficient environment for building RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database.
- **Supabase**: Can be used for simplified authentication, real-time database features, and other backend services.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, useful for caching and improving response times.

### AI & Machine Learning

- Integration with OpenAI GPT-4 for natural language queries
- Mistral 7B (or similar) for local, offline fact generation capabilities.
- Potential for integrating machine learning models for inventory optimization, sales forecasting, and personalized recommendations (future development).
